The OpenSHMEM Analyzer test codes

These programs are intentionally broken in various ways so that either
the configure option --enable-debug or the OpenSHMEM Analyzer can detect
the problems.

Compile each of the codes with the command:
uhcc -shmem-analyzer test-code.c
This will automaticaly invoke the OpenSHMEM analyzer.

The OpenSHMEM Analyzer Tool itself is available either as a pre-built executable, OpenUH version 3.0.38, or as source:
OpenSHMEM Analyzer Tool at http://web.cs.uh.edu/~openuh/download/
